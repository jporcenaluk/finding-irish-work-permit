This is an application that does the following:

- imports a csv of a list of companies
- sorts companies by name alphabetically
- looks up their respective location via Google Places API
- finds out if that location is within a 10 mile radius of Galway, Ireland
- puts the companies (and their respective addresses) into a new comma-delimited csv file
- includes the timestamp of the process date of each company
